// Implement a binarySearchTree class with the following properties:
// A .left property, a binary search tree (BST) where all values are lower than than it the current value.
// A .right property, a BST where all values are higher than than it the current value.
// A .insert() method, which accepts a value and places in the tree in the correct position.
// A .contains() method, which accepts a value and returns a boolean reflecting whether or not the value is contained in the tree.
// A .depthFirstLog() method, which accepts a callback and executes it on every value contained in the tree.
// What is the time complexity of the above functions?
